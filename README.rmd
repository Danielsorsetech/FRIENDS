# F.R.I.E.N.D.S
## The One with All the Data :D

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends

The idea is to analyze and understand F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV series(1994-2004) in detail using transcripts from http://www.friendstranscripts.tk/.

F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV series Lead Characters aka *The FRIENDS* are **Chandler, Joey, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel and Ross**.

These are some of the the observations by me :

### Rachels speaks the most!

In the below plot you can see Number of dialogues (**#dialogues**) for all episodes on Y-axis with Lead-Characters on X-axis.

Overall #dialogues by all characters are kind of close to each other's, with Rachel delivering the highest *(15,707)* and Phoebe the least*(12,443)*. Chandler*(14,091)*, Joey*(13,865)* & Monica*(14,032)* are in the same league and Rachel & Ross*(15174)* are in the other. I guess you can expect that Phoebe would have the least #dialuges out of all.

### Number of Dialogues in each Season

   **Season 6** has the *highest* #dialogues (10,897) out of all Ten seasons. And season 5 *(10,738)*, season 6 & season 7*(10,798)* have almost same #dialogues. Maybe the writers tended to create more contect toward the middle of the series.

   And also it is obvious that something went wrong while extracting data for **Season 2** as #dialogues for this season*(1,416)* are pretty less compared with all other seasons. I have to revisit the scrit again to extract the data properly for this season. And it's also worth to check data extraction script for season 10 as well as #dialogues for this season *(4,392)* doesn't compare well with others.

**The plot below tells us who spoke the most in each season**.

Even from this plot it's clear that Phoebe spoke the least.

Even from the above plots it's clear that more work might be needed to extract data from Seasons 1 & 10.
