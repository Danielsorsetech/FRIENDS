# F.R.I.E.N.D.S
## The One with All the Data :D

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends

The idea is to analyze and understand F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV series(1994-2004) in detail using transcripts from http://www.friendstranscripts.tk/.

F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV series Lead Characters aka *The FRIENDS* are **Chandler, Joey, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel and Ross**.

These are some of the the observations by me :

###Rachels speaks the most!

In the below plot you can see Number of dialogues (#dialogues) for all episodes on Y-axis with Lead-Characters on X-axis.

Overall #dialogues by all characters are kind of close to each other's, with Rachel delivering the highest (15,707) and Phoebe the least(12,443). Chandler(14,091), Joey(13,865) & Monica(14,032) are in the same league and Rachel & Ross(15174) are in the other. I guess you can expect that Phoebe would have the least #dialuges out of all.
