# F.R.I.E.N.D.S
## The One with All the Data :D

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends

The idea is to analyze and understand F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV series(1994-2004) in detail using transcripts from http://www.friendstranscripts.tk/.


These are some of the the observations by me :

###Rachels speaks the most!

In the below plot you can see #dialogues on Y-axis with FRIENDS Lead-Characters on X-axis.

Overall #dialogues by all characters are kind of close to each other, with Rachel delivering the highest (15707) and Phoebe the least(12443). Chandler(14091), Joey(13865) & Monica(14032) are in the same league and Rachel & Ross(15174) are in the other. I guess you can expect that phoebe would have the least #dialuges out of all.
