Data Journalism on F.R.I.E.N.D.S TV Series (1994 – 2004)
Notes by Puneeth Gandla – last updated on 28th October 2016

1. Plot ‘Episode #’ on X axis & ‘#Dialogues on Y-axis’ for all actors as line plots
2. Central Characters 
	a. Who is the Central Character of each season?
	b. Who is the Central Character of complete series?
3. How to segregate episodes by scenes?
4. Refine the number of dialogues into number of words by splitting each dialogue into words to get the most spoken person in the series/each episode
5. Which person spoke highest number of dialogues after the 6 main characters? (Can be in the quiz section of the blog)
6. Gender equality in friends –
	Which gender spoke highest number of dialogues/words? 
	What is the difference in the number of words spoken by each Gender?
7. Which is the best couple in the whole series? Which is the Best male pair? Which is the best Female pair? Which is the Best 3 friends group?
8. At what location (say Central Perk/Monica’s Apartment/Joey’s Apartment etc.) are most of the dialogues exchanged / series happened? Do ranking of these locations as well.
9. Did Ross loved Rachel more or Rachel loved Ross more? :P
10. Did Ross love Rachel more or Did Chandler love Monica more? :P
11. How sarcastic is Chandler? How can this be measured? Is there any way? (Not necessary to be serious : P)
12. What is the sex appeal of Joey compared with Ross/Chandler? (How can this be measured??)
13. How Dumb is Joey?
14. How weird is Phoebe?
15. How beautiful/sexy is Rachel?




Ideas for more plots 
1. Stacked Bar plot w.r.t Season# on X-axis (instead of episode#)
2. Stacked 100% Bar plot w.r.t Episode# on x-axis
3. Stacked 100% Bar plot w.r.t Season# on x-axis
4. Circular area charts (for each Friend)
5. Simple Pie Chart to show composition
6. y - Axis (0 to 1) Number of dialogues; x - axis episode number (labels - six lead characters)
7. Plot the above plot for all 10 seasons and for each season separately as well
8. Plot the contribution (0 to 1) of each lead character per episode
9. Rather than Episode Number in the plots, extract the actual name of episode and plot
10. Or replace episode number with SXXEXX format
11. Divide the main script into multiple small scripts for better understanding
